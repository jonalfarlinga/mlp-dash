My toddler wanted to join me in playing video games, but she still struggles with hand-eye coordination and connecting keys to on-screen actions. I decided to create this game with an ultra-simple premise and touch-screen compatibility. Rainbow Dash needs to clean the clouds from the sky so Equestria continues to have sunny days. But watch out for the changelings floating about!

# Installing

2. Download the files from [github](https://github.com/jonalfarlinga/mlp-dash)

# Run the game

# Gameplay

Rainbow Dash moves to any place the player clicks. If she runs into a cloud, she pops it. Once the skies are clear, Rainbow has saved the day! But beware the changelings hiding in the clouds! If Rainbow gets hit 3 times, she can't go on, and the game is over.
